###### Official Privacy Policy for Mi Shopping List iOS App


#### Privacy Policy for Mi Shopping List
At Mi Shopping List, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by **Mi Shopping List** and how we use it.
If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at <mishoppinglist@outlook.com>.


#### CloudKit
Mi Shopping List uses CloudKit to sync your shops across multiple devices, or to share a shop with another **Mi Shopping List** user. All these shops are stored in **YOUR** private iCloud container! And we cannot see or modify anything of it! So it's your own responsibility to keep it up to date and secure. Also when sharing a shop it doesn't mean it's accessible for anyone. The shop still exists in **YOUR** private database, and CloudKit made a copy of it in the other iCloud user's private database. CloudKit then makes sure they both keep updated. 


#### Log Files

These files log visitors when they use app. The information collected by log files include internal use, date and time stamp, and possibly the number of clicks.
